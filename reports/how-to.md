## Abstract

This tutorial is written to give a step-by-step tutorial on how your group can develop and design a final project webpage in the DeepRob "style". This tutorial involves concepts and tools used in web-development but we will assume no previous web-development experience.


### TL;DR

You will describe the contents on your page as a [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} file (e.g. [this page itself is a markdown file](https://github.com/opipari/DeepRobWeb/blob/w24/reports/how-to.md)){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The markdown file gets converted by a tool, called [Jekyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), into a proper [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} file and is served on the internet at a specific domain (e.g. 'deeprob.com') and subdirectory (e.g. '/w24/reports/how-to/').
