# Final Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build skills needed to understand and lead research projects in deep learning for robot perception. In this project you will read state of the art deep learning papers, reproduce results from an existing paper and finally propose then develop an extension to the existing results.

### The goals for this project are as follows:
 - Practice reading deep learning papers in your areas of interest.
 - Analyze the published motivations, results and methodologies in deep learning papers from the perspective of an academic reviewer.
 - Practice reproducing the results of published work. Build an understanding of what challenges are common when reproducing published results.
 - Propose an algorithmic extension to state of the art results, which could result in a workshop or conference submission.

## 1. Paper Review
{: #paper-review }

 - The goal for this deliverable is to practice the skills needed to serve as an academic peer reviewer.

 - [The structure of a review in robotics research](#review-structure)
 - [Useful Resources](#review-resources)

### What is peer review?

Academic peer review is the process by which research artifacts being considered for publication are evaluated by independent experts in the relevant field to determine the artifacts' suitability for publication. Typically, work considered for publication will be formatted as a written paper describing an experimental setup, the observed results and the researchers' motivations for carrying out the described experiments. Peer review of scholarly manuscripts plays a crucial role in academia and in advancing our body of knowledge. When you review a scholarly work, you are providing a service for the public, the field of researchers in your discipline, and the scholars whose work you are reviewing. You are serving the public and the field by providing an objective source of quality control and credibility to the work being considered for publication. At the same time, you're serving the scholars by providing input and perspective that can help cultivate new ideas and shape the work's relevance.

It is important to remember the distinction between [peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Science uses the testing of falsifiable hypotheses by reproducable experimentation to establish new knowledge. Peer review uses independent experts to evaluate the standards, quality and reputability of claimed scientific results. Notably, the standards of peer review are themselves judged and questioned by scientific communities. Fields contributing to research in deep learning for robot perception (i.e. robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, etc.) have been experimenting with an [open review process (Soergel et al., 2013)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=xf0zSBd2iufMg){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} intended to improve the quality, speed, and accountability of reviews.


### The structure of a review in robotics research
{: #review-structure }

Quality reviews will be formatted in two distinct sections: a review scoring and a review narrative. The review scoring section is an assessment of the manuscript based on its suitability for publication in the venue to which it was submitted (e.g. conference, journal, workshop, etc.). Notably as part of the scoring, the reviewer may be expected to score their own confidence in their review based on perceived expertise with respect to the paper under consideration. The review narrative is written feedback that is provided to authors to use for strengthening their work. <b>Students in DeepRob will only be expected to submit a review narrative as part of the final project (not a review scoring).</b>

A review narrative will generally be expected to address the following main points: a paper summary, a review summary, and a set of individual points of feedback. [See below](#review-format) for the expectated format in DeepRob.

In general, the tone of reviews should be positive about the work and constructive about the potential for contributions. The best reviews provide a clear rationale for how to move the paper forward. Especially useful is a list of items that need to be addressed for the paper to be acceptable for publication or to improve an already accepted paper.

In general, please do not use "I," "you," "the authors," etc. in your reviews. Reviews should be depersonalized as much as possible. The review should focus on the work and not the individuals involved with the work (neither authors nor reviewers).
