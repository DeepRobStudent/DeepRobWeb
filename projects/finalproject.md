# Final Project

## Overview
The objective of this project is to build skills needed to understand and lead research projects in deep learning for robot perception. In this project you will read state of the art deep learning papers, reproduce results from an existing paper and finally propose then develop an extension to the existing results.

### The goals for this project are as follows:
 - Practice reading deep learning papers in your areas of interest.
 - Analyze the published motivations, results and methodologies in deep learning papers from the perspective of an academic reviewer.
 - Increase .
 - Practice reproducing the results of published work. Build an understanding of what challenges are common when reproducing published results.
 - Propose an algorithmic extension to state of the art results, which could result in a workshop or conference submission.


## Project Deliverables

### 1. Paper Review

### 2. Paper Presentation

### 3. Paper Reproduction

### 4. Algorithmic Extension

### 5. Written Report
