# 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Written Report
{: #written-report}

The goal for this deliverable is to share the findings of your research in the form of a written paper with peers in the field.

## Expected Report Format
{: #report-format }

**Student teams in DeepRob should complete a written report documenting their paper reproduction and algorithmic extension as part of the final project.** The project report should include the following sections: a paper abstract, an introduction, a related work section, a section describing your algorithmic extension, your experimental setup and results, and finally a conclusion. Final reports are expected to be 4-6 pages, not including references. **Students are expected to typeset their reviews using LaTeX in IEEE conference style.** A [LaTeX report template]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/projects/DeepRobProjectReport.zip) is provided for your convenience. You may write your review collaboratively using online LaTeX tools, such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Report Deadline
{: #report-deadline }

**The written report is due Monday, April 29th by 11:59PM EST.**
Students in DeepRob should submit the following under Canvas "Final Project" assignment:
1. An IEEE-style written report (with related work, algorithmic reproduction and extension method descriptions and results).
2. Link to codes/datasets. This can be included as a section in your written report.
3. Link to final project video **or** final project webpage. Your group can choose to submit **either a webpage, or a video, or both!** The goal is to develop our skills for presenting our work in a compelling, precise, honest, and convincing way to others who can benefit from the ideas we produce.
  - Video option: This should be a self-contained video (i.e., please include title, group members' names, brief description to methods and results). No limit on video length but should describe your projects clearly. Please make sure the instructional team have access to your video.
  - Webpage option: If you would like to highlight your project with a webpage that can be included in portfolios or linked on social media, for exmple as [illustrated here]({{ site.baseurl }}/reports/example/), contact Anthony to help with formatting.
