# 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithmic Extension
{: #algorithmic-extension }

The goal for this deliverable is to gain experience crafting a small research project. In this process your team will propose a technical extension to an existing deep learning algorithm, plan how to analyze your proposed extension, and execute on the plan by implementing and evaluating the ideas you propose. The expectation is that your extension will build on the paper reproduction deliverable by using your reproduction as a starting point and baseline for the extension.
 - [Algorithmic Extension Deadline](#extension-deadline)


## Algorithmic Extension Deadline
{: #extension-deadline }

**The algorithmic extension is due Friday, April 29th by 11:59PM EST.** Students in DeepRob should submit their algorithmic extension along with the other final project deliverables (paper reproduction and written report) as a ZIP file [via canvas](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/671234/assignments/2340326). **Your submission should be documented and organized such that the course staff can replicate your extension and reported results.**
