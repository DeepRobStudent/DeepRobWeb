# Final Project

## Overview

The objective of this project is to build skills needed to understand and lead research projects in deep learning for robot perception. In this project you will read state of the art deep learning papers, reproduce results from an existing paper and finally propose then develop an extension to the existing results.

### The goals for this project are as follows:
 - Practice reading deep learning papers in your areas of interest.
 - Analyze the published motivations, results, and methodologies in deep learning papers from the perspective of an academic reviewer.
 - Present your analysis of an existing deep learning paper during the seminar portion of the course (starting [week 8]({{ site.baseurl }}/calendar/#week-8-3d-perception)).
 - Practice reproducing the results of published work. Build an understanding of what challenges are common when reproducing published results.
 - Propose an algorithmic extension to state of the art results, which could result in a workshop or conference submission.
 - Document the results of your work in a scholarly format so that they can be shared with peers and move the field forward.

### Project Deliverables

 1. [Paper Review]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/finalproject/review/)
